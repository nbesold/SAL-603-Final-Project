# Underdog Fantasy 'The Dinger' Analysis
Which roster construction was the most successful in the 2023 fantasy baseball season?

For this project I analyzed results from the 2023 fantasy baseball season, specifically Underdog Fantasy's "The Dinger" tournament.

In this tournament, users competed for an $100,000 first place prize against 50,000 other players.

In Python, I analyzed which types of roster constructions and draft strategies lead to the greatest success in 2023.
